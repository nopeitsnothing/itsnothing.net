        <title>What&apos;s a SIM card, and how do I secure it?</title>
        <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;perceived-sim-card-opsec&quot;&gt;Perceived SIM card OPSEC&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SIM cards provide a degree of privacy by allowing users to control their identity and access to mobile services, but users should also be mindful of other potential privacy risks and take appropriate measures to protect their personal information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Subscriber Identity Module is a topic which I have talked about on my blog before, but never at length. I’ve talked about what to do to prevent, or significantly lower the risk of, SIM swaps. But what are SIM cards? What do they store, really? I usually don’t find the need to talk about SIM cards in the realm of cybersecurity. However, it poses an interesting topic as it has received a rise in popularity as a threat rather than a convenience. Here, I will discuss the increase in cyberattacks targeting mobile phones, specifically SIM cards: (1) how do they work and (2) how do attackers leverage them for profit?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post is not to inform hackers on techniques, tools, and procedures (“TTPs”), but rather it should be considered an informative article on the dangers of mobile phones realistically, not just as some tinfoil persona. The cellular devices that you know and use (and likely carry everywhere) are not impervious to spyware, malware and unwanted behavior, however, most people don’t fully understand these risks and the importance of having the knowledge of how to protect your phones. Some dangers involved in carrying a mobile device include tracking, spyware, surveillance, and even stalking. We’ll discuss these all in depth, and we’ll also discuss ways to prevent them, or at least decrease the likelihood of being targeted by individuals, corporations, and even the government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;origins-of-the-sim-card-and-necessity-on-cell-networks&quot;&gt;Origins of the SIM card and necessity on cell networks&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the early 1990s, GSM (Group systems for mobile communications) was developed as a standard for mobile communication. It introduced the 2G protocol, which became widely used in smartphones. The first deployment of GSM took place in Finland in December 1991. Over time, GSM &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/2010/06/wired-explains-4g/&quot;&gt;evolved into 3G and 4G technologies&lt;/a&gt;. SIM (Subscriber Identity Module) cards are used to store user information such as IMSI, ICCID, Authentication Key, Location Area Identity (LAI), and national emergency call operator details. SIM cards provide identification and authentication across different telecom operators and incorporate &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COMP128&quot;&gt;COMP128v1&lt;/a&gt; authentication algorithms, including A3 for network security and A8 for encryption keys related to authentication key security. SIM cards come in different versions, including standard, micro, and nano.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Standard SIM: The standard SIM card, also known as a mini SIM, is the traditional form factor used in older mobile devices. It is larger in size compared to the newer versions and is gradually being phased out in favor of smaller SIM card types.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Micro SIM: The Micro SIM card is smaller than the standard SIM and was introduced to accommodate slimmer smartphones. It retains the same functionality as the standard SIM but has a reduced form factor.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Nano SIM: The Nano SIM card is the smallest SIM card type currently available and is commonly used in modern smartphones. It is significantly smaller than both the standard and micro SIM cards and requires specialized tools to handle due to its compact size.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SIM cards play a crucial role in the interaction between mobile devices and the GSM network. When a SIM card is inserted into a mobile device, it provides the necessary identification and authentication information for the device to connect to the GSM network. The SIM card stores essential data such as the International Mobile Subscriber Identity (IMSI), Integrated Circuit Card ID (ICCID), and authentication key. This information allows the device to establish a secure connection with the network and access services like voice calls, messaging, and mobile data. The GSM network uses the SIM card’s information to verify the user’s identity, authorize network access, and apply specific service features based on the user’s subscription. This interaction ensures the seamless functioning of mobile devices within the GSM network, enabling communication and access to various network services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;real-risks-of-sim-cards-and-its-implications&quot;&gt;Real risks of SIM cards and its implications&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By using the SIM card, customers can have a level of control over their personal information and access to mobile services. The SIM card allows customers to switch between different mobile devices while retaining their identity and subscribed services. This offers a level of privacy and convenience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, it’s important to note that while SIM cards provide some privacy protection, they do not guarantee complete privacy. Mobile network operators and authorized parties can still access certain information stored on the SIM card, such as call records and location data, for legitimate purposes like billing and providing network services. Additionally, SIM cards are subject to security vulnerabilities and can be targeted by hacking or unauthorized access attempts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why are hackers targeting SIM cards? Mostly for fraud, and otherwise profit. The SIM contains its own microprocessor (CPU), program memory (ROM), working memory (RAM), data memory (EPROM or E2PROM), and serial communication module. The SIM card interacts with the mobile device through a serial Input/output (I/O) connection, serving as a communication link. The T0 protocol is commonly used, defining the electrical coding for commands and responses between the mobile device and SIM card. The SIM card operates in a passive role, responding to commands from the mobile device and providing “Status Words” as responses. It cannot initiate communication with the device independently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SIM cards pose several &lt;a href=&quot;/2022/01/27/a-proper-threat-model.html&quot;&gt;threats to personal information security&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Confidential information&lt;/strong&gt;: SIM cards can store sensitive data like login IDs, passwords, and messages related to bank accounts and social networking sites, making them potential targets for unauthorized access and identity theft.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Personal and professional data&lt;/strong&gt;: SIM cards may contain personal and professional messages, important contact information, and call logs. If accessed by unauthorized individuals, this information could be exploited for malicious purposes.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Deleted data recovery&lt;/strong&gt;: deleted messages can potentially be recovered from SIM cards, posing a risk of privacy breaches even after data deletion.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data persistence&lt;/strong&gt;: SIM card data is resistant to various environmental conditions such as heat, flame, dust, moisture, stains, and magnetic fields. This persistence makes it difficult to destroy the data stored on a SIM card through ordinary means.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Physical damage&lt;/strong&gt;: while scratches and striations may not render a SIM card unreadable, physical damage inflicted by compression marks, such as from a stone or hammer, can make the card unreadable. I prefer to use a screwdriver or drill if I have time to spare. Screwdriver and hammer to split the “fibers” of embedded chips and capacitors, and a drill to completely penetrate and destroy the platters of storage devices.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data recovery&lt;/strong&gt;: even if a SIM card becomes unreadable or damaged, it can potentially be read by replacing the EEPROM chip into a new SIM card or by using proper probing techniques. This highlights the need for proper disposal or secure handling of old SIM cards.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To protect private data from being easily stolen using a SIM card reader, &lt;em&gt;it is recommended to break the SIM card into two pieces&lt;/em&gt; before discarding it, making it significantly harder for strangers or criminals to access private information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To prevent forensic recovery and ensure the secure disposal of a SIM card, &lt;em&gt;it is recommended to follow a thorough process that involves physical destruction&lt;/em&gt;. Here is an in-depth description of the process:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;protecting-yourself-against-forensics&quot;&gt;Protecting yourself against forensics&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You will need a pair of pliers, scissors, or a sharp knife, as well as safety gloves to protect your hands. Remove the SIM card from the mobile device. Power off the mobile device and locate the SIM card slot. You will use a SIM card ejector tool or a small paperclip to remove the SIM card from the device.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, disable the SIM card: access the device settings. Disable any security features or PIN codes associated with the SIM card. This step ensures that the SIM card does not prompt for authentication when attempting to access the data. When you’ve removed the SIM, physically destroy it by placing it on a flat and sturdy surface, and, using the pliers, scissors, or a sharp knife, applying pressure or cut through the SIM card. Start by severing the gold contacts and then proceed to cut or break the rest of the card into multiple pieces. Make sure to apply enough force to render the card irreparable. Dispose of the SIM card safely: once the SIM card is completely destroyed, separate the broken pieces. It is advisable to dispose of the pieces in separate trash bins or through different waste collection methods. This helps further ensure that the card cannot be reconstructed or retrieved. Remember, failure to dispose of SIM cards can result in retrieval of sensitive data. It is very important to not only physically destroy it but also &lt;em&gt;not to leave the pieces in the same bin&lt;/em&gt;. If it’s not incinerated or degaussed, you should always use at least two bins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By following this process, you significantly reduce the chances of forensic recovery and unauthorized access to the data stored on the SIM card. However, it’s critical to note that physical destruction does not guarantee absolute security, and if highly sensitive data is involved, additional precautions may be necessary, such as incineration or professional destruction services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;to-protect-yourself-follow-these-practices&quot;&gt;To protect yourself, follow these practices&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use strong authentication&lt;/strong&gt;: set a strong alphanumeric passcode for your SIM card to prevent unauthorized access, or at the very least, use a long PIN. This adds an extra layer of security, ensuring that even if your device is lost or stolen, your SIM card remains protected. Most telecoms will allow a registration PIN or subscriber PIN to prevent unauthorized changing of your number or inserting into a new device without your permission. This is one of the most important steps in this article.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enable two-factor authentication (2FA)&lt;/strong&gt;: whenever possible, enable 2FA for your mobile services. This is an additional step for authentication, typically involving a verification code sent to your SIM card, further securing your identity and preventing unauthorized access. You can use &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-based_one-time_password&quot;&gt;TOTP&lt;/a&gt; (time-based authentication mechanism) or something like a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.yubico.com/&quot;&gt;hardware key&lt;/a&gt; from Yubico. Store your TOTP separate from your passwords and do not keep them in your password manager, as any unauthorized access to your manager would lead to compromise of the sensitive time-based codes as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Regularly update software and firmware&lt;/strong&gt;: keep your mobile device’s software and firmware up to date. Updates often include security patches and bug fixes that help protect against potential vulnerabilities and threats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be wary of phishing attempts&lt;/strong&gt;: exercise caution when receiving text messages, emails, or phone calls asking for personal or sensitive information. Telecom providers typically do not request such information through unsolicited communications. Be vigilant and avoid sharing personal information unless you can verify the legitimacy of the request. Your bank and your telecom provider will never ask for your sensitive details over the phone. If they do, consider that it isn’t in your best interest to share anywhere but in person to a credentialed employee or technician.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Monitor account activities&lt;/strong&gt;: regularly review your mobile service account activities, such as call logs, text message records, and data usage. If you notice any suspicious or unfamiliar activities, report them to your telecom provider immediately. You have the option to subscribe to services that can do this for you, either manually or automatically, like &lt;a href=&quot;https://joindeleteme.com/&quot;&gt;Delete Me&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Secure network connections&lt;/strong&gt;: when accessing the internet or using mobile data, connect to secure and trusted networks. Avoid using public Wi-Fi networks, which can be susceptible to eavesdropping and data interception. Consider using a virtual private network (VPN) for additional privacy and encryption. &lt;strong&gt;VPNs do not offer anonymity.&lt;/strong&gt; You could also consider use of &lt;a href=&quot;https://safing.io/&quot;&gt;SafingIO’s SPN&lt;/a&gt; Anonymity can only be offered by proper onion routing via &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.torproject.org/&quot;&gt;the Tor network&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://geti2p.net/en/&quot;&gt;the i2p network&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Protect Physical Security&lt;/strong&gt;: keep your mobile device and SIM card in a secure location, such as a safe or loclbox. Avoid lending your device to others or leaving it unattended in public places. Do not hand your devices to strangers to make calls becasue this is a tactic used by thieves. You’d think this is common sense, but it has been used before to nab physical devices from darknet vendors and admins. Physical security of your device helps prevent unauthorized access. By following these measures, you can enhance the protection of your identity at the telecom level while using a SIM card, reducing the risk of identity theft, unauthorized access, and fraudulent activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, protecting your identity while using a SIM card requires a combination of proactive measures and responsible practices. By implementing strong authentication, enabling two-factor authentication, keeping your software up to date, being vigilant against phishing attempts, monitoring account activities, securing network connections, and maintaining physical security, you can significantly enhance the protection of your personal information. Besides the registration PIN at your provider, which can be a real life-saver, remember to dispose of old SIM cards properly by physically destroying them to prevent forensic recovery. By taking these precautions, you can enjoy a safer and more secure mobile experience, reducing the risk of identity theft and unauthorized access to your sensitive data.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Let&apos;s talk about the &quot;RESTRICT Act&quot;</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Let’s talk about the RESTRICT Act&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Senate text summary of S.686 - RESTRICT Act, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.congress.gov/member/mark-warner/W000805&quot;&gt;Sen. Warner, Mark R. [D-VA]&lt;/a&gt; (Introduced 03/07/2023) is as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“The purpose of the bill is to create a framework for the federal government to identify, assess, and address national security threats posed by certain types of information and communications technology (ICT) products and services.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It would prohibit federal agencies from purchasing or using specific products and services. The bill would also establish a grant program to assist small and rural communication providers in replacing any equipment or services that have been deemed to pose a national security threat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, the bill would establish a program within the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) to develop standards and guidelines for the secure use of ICT products and services, and it would require the Director of National Intelligence to provide an annual report on the national security risks posed by ICT products and services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, the goal of the RESTRICT Act is to strengthen the security of the United States’ ICT infrastructure by identifying and addressing potential national security threats posed by certain ICT products and services. It also appears that it references &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.archives.gov/isoo/policy-documents/cnsi-eo.html&quot;&gt;Executive Order 13526&lt;/a&gt; as well, an Order enacted by President Obama which summarily defines:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“a uniform system for classifying, safeguarding, and declassifying national security information, including information relating to defense against transnational terrorism”&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notice also the term “joint resolution” mentioned freely in its pages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Joint resolutions may originate either in the House of Representatives or in the Senate. There is little practical difference between a bill and a joint resolution. Both are subject to the same procedure, except for a joint resolution proposing an amendment to the Constitution. On approval of such a resolution by two-thirds of both the House and Senate, it is sent directly to the Administrator of General Services for submission to the individual states for ratification.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If that’s too confusing, the ELI5 is this type of resolution would be used if Congress wants to disagree with a determination made by the Secretary of Commerce under Section 3 of the bill. The section sets out a specific process for considering this type of resolution, including waiving certain rules and limiting debate to 10 hours. Waiving the requirements for a vote of disapproval or approval, in either case, would be highly unethical.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-does-this-bill-actually-introduce-into-federal-law&quot;&gt;What does this bill actually introduce into federal law?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;creation of a framework for the identification and assessment of national security risks posed by certain ICT products and services, including the establishment of an interagency process for identifying and assessing these risks;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;prohibition on federal agencies purchasing or using ICT products and services that have been identified as posing a national security risk;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;creation of a grant program to assist small and rural communication providers in replacing any equipment or services that have been deemed to pose a national security risk;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;establishment of a program within the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) to develop standards and guidelines for the secure use of ICT products and services;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the requirement for the Director of National Intelligence to provide an annual report on the national security risks posed by ICT products and services.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this sense, the RESTRICT Act could be seen as a way for the federal government to exert greater control over the purchase, use, and sale of certain ICT equipment and services that are deemed to pose a national security threat. (Essentially, as it sees fit to do so.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, up to and including the VPNs and virtual credit cards services we all know and love. :(&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;First, let’s note a couple things about them:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;paid to secure &lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt; infrastructure - can’t even secure &lt;em&gt;their&lt;/em&gt; infrastructure a majority of the time&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;account for majority of large-scale attacks on FVEY by foreign gov&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So can they really be trusted with our nation’s infrastructure?&lt;/p&gt;

not. Why?&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Windows 11</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Windows 11 is trying to take away your autonomy by imposing lockdown and -
while this may not be new - it has evolved slowly into a monopoly over your
data. Now you are locked into their services; &lt;em&gt;their&lt;/em&gt; cloud, &lt;em&gt;their&lt;/em&gt;
software, &lt;em&gt;their&lt;/em&gt; hardware modules. They have been boiling you slowly in a
pot for so long, you are becoming comfortable with it, and even, in some
extreme cases, you are &lt;strong&gt;forced&lt;/strong&gt; to get into the water.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want encryption and you’re not tech savvy, you’re forced to use Windows’ 
encryption software (Bitlocker). If you want to save your data but aren’t
tech savvy, you likely turn to easy solutions like this because it’s what is
shipped in Windows Home. The average consumer is very forcibly “asked” to use
their software and hardware in order to keep you so walled in that you can’t
function without them. It’s very hard, as with Google and its parent company
Alphabet, to switch out of this mindset.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a prison but you can break free.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Using Zettlr for note-taking</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I find that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zettlr.com/&quot;&gt;Zettlr&lt;/a&gt; [&lt;em&gt;ˈset·lər&lt;/em&gt;] and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zotero.org/&quot;&gt;Zotero&lt;/a&gt; make my life easier. I
have used it to make bibliographies with several papers now, all while
keeping a digital &lt;a href=&quot;https://wikiless.org/wiki/Zettelkasten&quot;&gt;Zettelkasten&lt;/a&gt;. It just requires knowledge of Markdown
syntax and how to use Zettlr for note-taking. The best part is how easy it
is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You just need to download the extension for Zotero which is what you will be
using to create citations – without having to install plugins on the website.
You simply open Zotero, create a “Collection”, then you add references as you
browse. If you go to a link in your browser and click the “Save to Zotero”
button for the extension (it’s available for both Firefox and Chrome/Chromium
browsers), you can save multiple references in your Collection. This allows
you to, when done, simply export to a bibliography in various formats. It
makes note-taking a breeze and it improves your ability to read without
having to stop so often to manually write up your references and lookup
things. There is a very handy setting in Zotero that allows to import all
metadata for a certain DOI or arxiv number, just by pasting the number into
the “Add Item(s) by Identifier” button. It pulls all the information for you
in a second. No more manual references. The only thing is you will have to
manually set the reference pointers like I have done in this post. Numbering
and setting the #refs themselves is pretty easy, just create a numbered list
in the markdown editor or your IDE.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>What exactly does Windows collect on you? Well..</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Just from one angle, the Bluetooth and Wi-Fi?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Geo-location via Wi-Fi &amp;amp; Bluetooth: Whether it is Android, iOS, Windows,
macOS, or even Ubuntu. Most popular Operating Systems now collect telemetry
information by default even if you never opt-in or opted-out from the start.
Some like Windows will not even allow disabling telemetry completely without
some technical tweaks. This information collection can be extensive and
include a staggering number of details (metadata and data) on your devices
and their usage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Itemized lists&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/privacy/required-windows-diagnostic-data-events-and-fields-2004&quot;&gt;Full list of required diagnostic data&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/privacy/windows-diagnostic-data&quot;&gt;Full list of optional diagnostic data&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mitigation:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;W10Privacy:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Download and install &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w10privacy.de/english-home/&quot;&gt;W10Privacy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Right-click&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;gt; &lt;strong&gt;Run as administrator&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Check all the recommended (Green) settings and save.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Optional but recommended (but could break things, use at your own risk), also
check the orange/red settings, and save.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reboot&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WindowsSpyBlocker:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Download and run &lt;a href=&quot;https://crazymax.dev/WindowsSpyBlocker/download/&quot;&gt;WindowsSpyBlocker&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Type &lt;strong&gt;1&lt;/strong&gt; and go into &lt;strong&gt;Telemetry&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Type &lt;strong&gt;1&lt;/strong&gt; and go into &lt;strong&gt;Firewall&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Type &lt;strong&gt;2&lt;/strong&gt; and add &lt;strong&gt;Spy Rules&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reboot&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Also, consider using O&amp;amp;O ShutUp10++:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Download and run &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.oo-software.com/en/shutup10&quot;&gt;O&amp;amp;O ShutUp10++&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Enable &lt;em&gt;at least&lt;/em&gt; all of the recommended settings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Settings&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;gt; &lt;strong&gt;Privacy&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;gt; &lt;strong&gt;Diagnostic&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;gt; &lt;strong&gt;Delete all Data&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You will need to update and re-run W10Privacy and WindowsSpyBlocker frequently
 and after any Windows update as they tend to silently re-enable telemetry using
 those updates.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a bonus, it could be interesting to also consider

        <title>Take back control of your data</title>
        <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;steps&quot;&gt;Steps:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Embrace a zero trust model.
Don’t rely on reactive security practices.
Never trust. Always verify.
Never put all your eggs into one basket.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are ~3 things you should absolutely be doing:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Better passwords:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;go change them all, &lt;strong&gt;seriously, right now!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;use strong/non-unique passwords (&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/grempe/diceware&quot;&gt;diceware&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;never mix or reuse them across services/accounts&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;use a password manager (preferably offline, like KeePassXC)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;avoid sharing passwords and use something that notifies you of breaches
(but don’t rely solely on reactive security)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;enable 2FA/MFA, possibly use hardware keys/tokens&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;backup everything just in case&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;update your OS with security updates and employ active IDS/IPS (it’s not as
hard as it sounds)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;disable and/or avoid telemetry from your OS, browser and IoT devices&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;don’t use browser storage for sensitive info including passwords&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Better browsing:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;block ads at the host level (Pi-hole, DNSSEC/DNSCRYPT, /etc/hosts, router VPN)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;uBlock Origin, LibRedirect, Smart Referrer&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;ensure website integrity (in Tor, you can verify a site’s /mirrors.txt)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;use a private search engine (SearXNG, DuckDuckGo, Brave)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;don’t use unnecessary extensions (cf.
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/arkenfox/user.js/wiki/4.1-Extensions#-dont-bother&quot;&gt;https://github.com/arkenfox/user.js/wiki/4.1-Extensions&lt;/a&gt;) -
useless bullshit&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;use HTTPS (default in your regular browser usually)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;DNS over HTTPS (DOH)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;containerize and/or sanitize browsing in-between sessions, 
(again, Arkenfox/user.js)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;minimize your footprint/fingerprint (Firefox RFP)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;plain-text emails only, question all attachments from all sources&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Practice your OPSEC:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;don’t login on another person’s device and use privacy shields if you can&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;avoid password hints or use answers that have nothing to do with them
(confuse the enemy :))&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;don’t use a 4-digit pin for your devices, use a strong password&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;minimize or eliminate the SMS 2FA for services to avoid SIM swaps&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;avoid using your password manager for OTP&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;avoid face and biometric unlocks&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;never reuse usernames&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;use a mail forwarding service to combat spam (and further confuse the enemy)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;use security keys (YubiKey, etc.) for U2F/OATH/FIDO; they are resistant to phishing&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Lissy93/personal-security-checklist&quot;&gt;personal security checklist&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <title>Removing microdots from printed documents</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Anonymize your documents by removing metadata and ensure you don’t have any
identifying marks embedded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For hundreds of years, paper and printing techniques are the foundation for
distribution of information. Thereby, physical documents enjoy high
confidence. To have something in “black and white” carries significance. But
forgery or alteration of documents are nearly as old as the history of
writing. Hence the question for the originator is important. Nowadays,
because of continual technological development, even individuals can print
high-quality documents and duplicates. This can be done with cheap and
customary devices. In addition image processing software, like GIMP or Adobe
Photoshop, allows to manipulate documents and images easily. Therefore
printed documents are often an issue in crimes, e.g. faked proof of identity,
copyright theft, or as exhibit in a criminal case. In all this cases it could
be useful for law enforcement agencies to, e.g., identify the device or model
which was used to print the questionable document.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The primary focus of the research lies on the extraction of artifacts, which
are originated from the print process. These artifacts emerge particularly
through electromechanical imperfections and also through differences between
constructions of printer models. We try to find and analyze artifacts which
are stable and e.g. model specific and therefore usable as intrinsic
signatures for a specific printer model. The extraction of these signatures
should be conducted with customary scanner devices and image processing
techniques. Simultaneously, the company Dence (cooperation partner) will
investigate the scanner forensics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second part of the project deals with research of print-scan resilient
checks of duplicates. Here the knowledge about artifacts which occur in the
print and scan process represent a reliable basis. As use case the typical
workflow in an insurance can be mentioned. In the event of damage, the
insured person would take a photo of the damage and send it postal, together
with forms, to the insurance. Afterwards the insurance will scan these
documents. The insurance staff examines the event of damage on the basis of
the digital reproduction. Because of the print and scan processes, which the
original document went through, the question of authenticity of the document
is difficulty to answer. Goal of the analysis is the implementation of an
image search for duplicates, which is resilient against the print and scan
process. This means, that images can also be matched, if only printed and
re-digitized versions are available. The duplicate testing must be able to
check an image immediately against a data pool with millions of images. From
technical view, this will be realized with a distinct image hash. The
challenge for the print-scan scenario is the computation of this hash. The
hash value has to be equal or very similar between the original photo and the
printed and re-digitized image, so that they can matched. Another difficulty
is a working check for duplicates also with slight manipulations in the
image (like a car scratch). All of this must be accomplished without matching
false positives.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Telegram is Giving Data to German Feds in Certain Cases</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Telegram has provided the German Federal Criminal Police Office with user
information in several cases, contradicting the company’s statements about
complying with law enforcement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Telegram, which is not an encrypted messaging application by default, released
user data to the Federal Criminal Police Office (BKA) in several cases,
according to &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20220605102156/https://www.spiegel.de/netzwelt/apps/telegram-gibt-nutzerdaten-an-das-bundeskriminalamt-a-0e4d3fcb-8081-4b87-b062-db412bbc294b&quot; title=&quot;Telegram hält sich neuerdings an Gesetze, zumindest ein bisschen&quot;&gt;a report from Spiegel&lt;/a&gt;. According
to the news outlet, Telegram handed over subscriber information for the suspects
in “child abuse and terrorism” investigations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20220605091308/https://telegram.org/faq#q-what-are-your-thoughts-on-internet-privacy&quot; title=&quot;Telegram FAQ&quot;&gt;The company claims&lt;/a&gt; that they have disclosed “0 bytes of user data” to law
enforcement:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Do you process data requests?
“Secret chats use end-to-end encryption, thanks to which we don’t have any
data to disclose.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“To protect the data that is not covered by end-to-end encryption, Telegram
uses a distributed infrastructure. Cloud chat data is stored in multiple data
centers around the globe that are controlled by different legal entities spread
across different jurisdictions. The relevant decryption keys are split into
parts and are never kept in the same place as the data they protect. As a
result, several court orders from different jurisdictions are required to force
us to give up any data.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Thanks to this structure, we can ensure that no single government or block of
like-minded countries can intrude on people’s privacy and freedom of expression.
Telegram can be forced to give up data only if an issue is grave and universal
enough to pass the scrutiny of several different legal systems around the world.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“&lt;strong&gt;To this day, we have disclosed 0 bytes of user data to third parties,
including governments.&lt;/strong&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://darknetlive.com/post/telegram-handing-data-over-to-german-feds/images/rq.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to Spiegel, “it is still difficult for German investigators to
obtain information from Telegram” when investigating crimes outside of the
scope of purported “terrorism” or child abuse. Since 2018, if not earlier,
the company has been moving towards a state of functional compliance with
various Western governments. A privacy policy change in 2018 allowed for the
disclosure of IP addresses and phone numbers if required by a court.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The paragraph below appears under a section titled, “Who Your Personal Data
May Be Shared With” in &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20220605092126/https://telegram.org/privacy#2-legal-ground-for-processing-your-personal-data&quot; title=&quot;Telegram Privacy Policy&quot;&gt;the company’s privacy policy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Law Enforcement Authorities&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“If Telegram receives a court order that confirms you’re a terror suspect, we
may disclose your IP address and phone number to the relevant authorities. So
far, this has never happened. When it does, we will include it in a semiannual
transparency report published at:
&lt;a href=&quot;https://t.me/transparency.%22&quot;&gt;https://t.me/transparency.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Governments have historically used the “terrorism loophole” to justify invasive
measures. Since the United States spies on Americans for counterterrorism
purposes, there is no reason to believe Germany would not use the same excuse.&lt;/p&gt;
