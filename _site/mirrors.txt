Onion Mirror Guidelines ("OMG")
Version alpha

You must host these text files at all of your .onion URLs:

/pgp.txt - Required - HTTP 200 text/plain
  - A list of all PGP public keys allowed to announce your official mirrors.
  - May contain multiple PGP keys.
  - All keys must be ASCII armored.
  - Do not list a key here unless it is trusted to sign official .onion URLs.
  - Example: http://darkfailllnkf4vf.onion/pgp.txt

/mirrors.txt - Required - HTTP 200 text/plain
  - PGP SIGNED list of all official mirrors of your site.
  - Mirrors must be signed by a PGP key which is in /pgp.txt hosted at all of your URLs.
  - Any line in this file which begins with “http://“ or “https://“
    is an official mirror of your site.
  - Mirrors must all host the same content. No related forums, no link lists.
    Place forums, other sites in /related.txt instead.
  - All valid mirrors must only contain a scheme and domain name, no
    ports or paths.
  - /pgp.txt and /mirrors.txt must have the same content on all of your URLs.
  - Text which is not intended to be parsed as an official mirror must
    be commented out with a “#” as the first character on the line.
  - Example: http://darkfailllnkf4vf.onion/mirrors.txt

/canary.txt - Required - HTTP 200 text/plain
  - PGP SIGNED message MUST be updated every 14 days.
  - Can be signed by any key specified in /pgp.txt
  - The message must contain the latest Bitcoin block hash and the current
    date in YYYY-MM-DD format, with string “I am in control of my PGP key.”
    and must also include the string "I will update this canary within 14 days."
  - If you cannot do this you should not be running a darknet market.
  - Example: http://darkfailllnkf4vf.onion/canary.txt

/related.txt - Optional - HTTP 200 text/plain
  - PGP SIGNED list of all .onion sites related to your site.
  - This is where you list forums, link lists, related services.
  - Follow the same rules as /mirrors.txt
