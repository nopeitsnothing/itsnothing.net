# Mirrors.txt Rules:
#  - Mirrors must be signed by a PGP key which is in /pgp.txt hosted at all of your URLs.
#  - Any line in this file which begins with “http://“ or “https://“ is an official mirror of your site.
#  - Mirrors must all host the same content. No forums, no link lists. Place those in /related.txt following these same standards.
#  - All valid mirrors must only contain a scheme and domain name, no ports or paths.
#  - /pgp.txt and /mirrors.txt must have the same content on all of your URLs.
#  - Text which is not intended to be parsed as an official mirror must be commented out with a “#” as the first character on the line.
