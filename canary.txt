I am the admin of itsnothing.net (@Unknown@ioc.exchange) and co-admin of THGTOA.
I will update this canary within 1 month. Sorry for any possible confusion this
may cause.

Latest bitcoin block hash:
00000000000000000001658f241becbecbf4449d954b0649160054a41f16a5bd

I am in complete control of all my key material.

All previous keys have been revoked as part of standard OPSEC key rotation procedures. 
Do NOT encrypt communications to my old keys, I will not read them.

The key currently published on my website https://itsnothing.net/pgp.txt with a fingerprint 
of 8B3A74890536BAD50D9376EBF1CB32F67E3302A1, is my only PGP key for public communication.

It is NOT published on any keyservers. Please refrain from uploading it there.

Permanent record of old and new PGP keys:

the old key(s) were:

pub   rsa4096/0xB208C4084A2C582D 2022-11-04 [SC] [expires: 2027-11-03]
      Key fingerprint = D793 9998 F78B ADB5 18C1  B600 B208 C408 4A2C 582D
uid                   [ultimate] Nope <no@anonymousplanet.org>

pub   ed25519/0x21AB6B6A6CB2C337 2023-07-14 [SC]
      Key fingerprint = C87D 8746 6FD2 0594 5CF1  0A38 21AB 6B6A 6CB2 C337
uid                   [ultimate] nopenothinghere@proton.me <nopenothinghere@proton.me>

and the new key is:

pub   ed25519/0xF1CB32F67E3302A1 2024-03-29 [SC]
      Key fingerprint = 8B3A 7489 0536 BAD5 0D93  76EB F1CB 32F6 7E33 02A1
uid                   [ultimate] nopenothinghere@proton.me <nopenothinghere@proton.me>

To fetch the full key, you can simply do:

  gpg --keyserver keys.openpgp.org --recv-key 0xF1CB32F67E3302A1

**
  Note: this keyserver is experimental.[0] I still have yet to add these keys
  to the I2P keyserver pool, and I don't know if I will. If you have previously
  signed my key but did a local-only signature (lsign), you will not want to
  issue the following, instead you will want to use --lsign-key, and not send
  the signatures to the keyserver.
**

  gpg --sign-key 0xF1CB32F67E3302A1

I'd like to receive your signatures on my key. You can either send me an e-mail
with the new signatures (if you have a functional MTA on your system):

  gpg --export 0xF1CB32F67E3302A1 | gpg --encrypt -r 0xF1CB32F67E3302A1 --armor \
      | mail -s 'OpenPGP Signatures' <nopenothinghere@proton.me>

Additionally, I highly recommend that you implement a mechanism to keep your key
material up-to-date so that you obtain the latest revocations, and other updates
in a timely manner. You can do regular key updates by using parcimonie[1] to
refresh your keyring. Parcimonie is a daemon that slowly refreshes your keyring
from a keyserver over Tor. It uses a randomized sleep, and fresh tor circuits
for each key. The purpose is to make it hard for an attacker to correlate the
key updates with your keyring.

I also highly recommend checking out the excellent Riseup GPG best practices
doc, from which I stole most of the text for this transition message ;-)

Please let me know if you have any questions, or problems, and sorry for the
inconvenience.
