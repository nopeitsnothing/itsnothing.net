Permanent record of old and new PGP keys:

the old key was:

pub   rsa4096/0xB208C4084A2C582D 2022-11-04 [SC] [expires: 2027-11-03]
      Key fingerprint = D793 9998 F78B ADB5 18C1  B600 B208 C408 4A2C 582D
uid                   [ultimate] Nope <no@anonymousplanet.org>

And the new key is:

pub   ed25519/0x21AB6B6A6CB2C337 2023-07-14 [SC]
      Key fingerprint = C87D 8746 6FD2 0594 5CF1  0A38 21AB 6B6A 6CB2 C337
uid                   [ultimate] nopenothinghere@proton.me <nopenothinghere@proton.me>

To fetch the full key, you can simply do:

  gpg --keyserver keys.openpgp.org --recv-key 0x21AB6B6A6CB2C337

**
  Note: this keyserver is experimental.[0] I still have yet to add this key to
  the I2P keyserver pool, and I don't know if I will. If you have previously
  signed my key but did a local-only signature (lsign), you will not want to
  issue the following, instead you will want to use --lsign-key, and not send
  the signatures to the keyserver.
**

  gpg --sign-key 0x21AB6B6A6CB2C337

I'd like to receive your signatures on my key. You can either send me an e-mail
with the new signatures (if you have a functional MTA on your system):

  gpg --export 0x21AB6B6A6CB2C337 | gpg --encrypt -r 0x21AB6B6A6CB2C337 --armor \
      | mail -s 'OpenPGP Signatures' <nopenothinghere@proton.me>

Additionally, I highly recommend that you implement a mechanism to keep your key
material up-to-date so that you obtain the latest revocations, and other updates
in a timely manner. You can do regular key updates by using parcimonie[1] to
refresh your keyring. Parcimonie is a daemon that slowly refreshes your keyring
from a keyserver over Tor. It uses a randomized sleep, and fresh tor circuits
for each key. The purpose is to make it hard for an attacker to correlate the
key updates with your keyring.

I also highly recommend checking out the excellent Riseup GPG best practices
doc, from which I stole most of the text for this transition message ;-)

Please let me know if you have any questions, or problems, and sorry for the
inconvenience.
